# Falling Flat: The Decline of the Premier League Relegation Battle (2000â€“2025)

This project explores the diminishing competitiveness of the Premier League relegation battle from 2000 to 2025 using Python, SQL, and data visualization.

Using data engineering and statistical analysis, this project aims to reveal trends in how newly promoted teams struggle to survive, how early-season predictability has reduced the drama of the run-in, and how financial disparity has widened the gap between bottom-tier and mid-table clubs.

## Objectives

- Analyze survival rates of promoted teams.
- Identify how early relegation zones are determined.
- Measure competitiveness at the bottom of the league.
- Visualize patterns and trends over 25 seasons.

## Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, SQLAlchemy)
- PostgreSQL / SQLite
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Plotly Dash (optional)

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed data
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for ETL and scraping
- `sql/`: Query files
- `notebooks/`: Step-by-step analysis
- `presentation/`: Slides and visuals for presentation

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Set up your database (`schema.sql`)
3. Run ETL scripts to populate tables
4. Open notebooks to follow the analysis

### Data Sources

FBref (stats per season, standings, match results)

Wikipedia (promotion/relegation teams)

Understat (advanced stats like xG)

Transfermarkt (squad value, transfers, injuries)

## Conclusion:

Statistically demonstrate that the relegation battle has become more predictable.

Showcase that financial inequality and promotion/relegation churn have played a role.

Possibly recommend how the Premier League can restore the jeopardy.
